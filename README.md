# Convert

This is a small script created on the basis of an older `convert_all.py` and with help from ChatGPT.

* We have 2 .py files - 
    - convert_all_chatgpt.py 
    - convert_test.py
*  convert_test.py _tests_ convert_all_chatgpt.py

## Current status

- [x] test_identify_file
- [x] test_convert_to_mp4
- [x] test_convert_to_doc
- [x] test_convert_to_svg
- [x] test_convert_file 
- [ ] test w/ some real reference data

## (non-python) Requirements

A long story best understood by reading the included Dockerfile

```bash
make build
```
but if you don't want to use docker read on. . .

### Install
you will need
* java runtime
* libreoffice
* ffmpeg
* inkscape
* and probably some other stuff

Ideally eventually we version freeze all these os-level reqs. into a docker image, the current setup is slow and generally non-repeatable as we move across OSs/users.

on a Mac you can try a _make_ target to install some of these - no promises
```
make macos-reqs
```

### Adjust

**Please adjust the path to .jar and libreoffice binary in convert_all_chatgpt.py**

### Verify java runtime
you will need java runtime - verify with `java --version`

## Quick start

Once the above (non-python) reqs are satisfied - try this

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
run the tests

```bash
python3 -m unittest convert_test.TestFileConversion
```

## with docker
%docker run -it -v $(PWD):/app convert:local  /bin/bash


docker run -it  convert:local /bin/bash
